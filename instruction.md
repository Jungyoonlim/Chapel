Action: Add Tailwind configuration and set up a basic color/token system (if needed).
Action: Set up TypeScript strict mode and define necessary types and interfaces in a types/ folder.
Phase 2: Building the Core Canvas
Actions for AI Agents
Canvas Rendering Prototype

Action: Create a Canvas.tsx component that initializes a PixiJS or Konva canvas inside a React component.
Action: Implement basic panning and zooming functionality.
Add mouse wheel event handlers for zoom.
Add click-and-drag support for panning.
Action: Add basic object rendering (e.g., rectangles or circles) to confirm rendering pipeline works.
Infinite Canvas and Grid

Action: Implement an infinite canvas concept by updating view transforms rather than redrawing a fixed space.
Action: Add a subtle grid or dot pattern background that scales with zoom to give users a sense of spatial orientation.
User Interaction Hooks

Action: Implement a hook (useCanvasInteraction) that manages input events (mouse, touch, keyboard) for the canvas.
Action: Integrate snapping logic (snap to grid or align objects) as a small utility function.
Phase 3: Dynamic Modules and Intent-Oriented UI
Actions for AI Agents
Intent-Orchestrator Backend Endpoint

Action: Create a backend endpoint /api/intent that receives a user’s natural language input.
Action: Integrate OpenAI (or another LLM) to parse the intent and return a structured JSON:
json
Copy code
{
  "action": "plan",
  "goal": "product launch",
  "widgets": ["timeline", "task_list"]
}
Action: Write a minimal prompt and logic in the backend to infer the required modules and their configuration.
Dynamic Widget Loader

Action: On the frontend, create a WidgetManager component that listens to the orchestrator’s response.
Action: For each widget type (e.g., timeline), dynamically import a corresponding React component and mount it on the canvas at a default position.
Example: import('./widgets/Timeline') on demand.
Ephemeral UI Components

Action: Implement a lifecycle method for widgets:
Appear when the orchestrator decides they’re needed.
Provide a close/done action that removes them from the canvas.
Action: Add a state manager (using Zustand or Context) that holds a list of active widgets and their states.
Action: Ensure that removing a widget cleans up any event listeners and state references.
Phase 4: Advanced Interactions and Performance
Actions for AI Agents

Action: Use Framer Motion to animate widget appearance (fade in, scale in).
Action: Add hover tooltips for widgets, using conditional rendering and a lightweight tooltip library or custom component.
Virtualization and Performance

Action: If the canvas has many objects, integrate virtualization. Test performance with a large set of objects (e.g., 1000 shapes) and optimize.
Action: Experiment with WebGL layers (via PixiJS) to ensure smooth 60fps interactions.
Lazy Loading & WASM Integration

Action: Introduce a single WASM module (e.g., a simple chart generator built in Rust and compiled to WASM).

Phase 5: Polishing the UI/UX and Aesthetics
Actions for AI Agents

Action: Add small loading animations when a widget is requested and being loaded dynamically.
Contextual Menus

Action: Implement right-click or long-press context menus that appear near selected widgets or canvas items.

Phase 6: AI Integration and User Testing
Actions for AI Agents
Enhanced Intent Parsing

Action: Improve the backend prompt engineering so that the AI better understands complex commands (e.g., “Plan a product launch in Q4 with budget and timeline”).
Action: Implement a feedback loop: If the user corrects the AI’s guess, store that feedback to refine prompts or add few-shot examples.
Smart Suggestions

Action: Implement a feature where the orchestrator suggests next steps or widgets (e.g., if user places a timeline, the system suggests adding tasks).
Action: Show suggestions as subtle UI hints or a small “AI suggestions” panel.
User Testing and Iteration

Action: Conduct a small internal user test.
Action: Gather feedback on how intuitive the no-app-overhang approach is.
Action: Iterate on design elements, widget interactions, and loading times based on feedback.
Phase 7: Integration with External Services
Actions for AI Agents
External API Hooks

Action: Add integration endpoints (e.g., connect to Google Calendar or Asana) via backend routes /api/integrations/calendar, /api/integrations/tasks.
Action: On certain intents (like “schedule a meeting”), dynamically load calendar-related widgets and interact with external APIs to fetch or submit data.
Authentication and Persistence

Action: Implement user authentication (e.g., OAuth with Google) so that saved states (widgets, positions, tasks) can be persisted.
Action: Use a database (PostgreSQL or Firebase) to store canvas layouts and widget configurations.
Action: Add real-time syncing (e.g., using WebSockets) so multiple users can collaborate on the canvas.
Phase 8: Production Readiness
Actions for AI Agents

Phase 9: Continuous Improvement
Actions for AI Agents
Iterate on AI Models

Action: Continually refine the AI prompts and model usage for better, more accurate intent recognition.
Action: Experiment with custom fine-tuned models or embeddings for domain-specific intents.
Enhanced UI Patterns

Action: Add more widget types (e.g., Gantt charts, mind maps, whiteboarding tools).
Action: Explore 3D interactions or AR/VR contexts if desired.
User Feedback Loop

Action: Implement an in-app feedback form.
Action: Gather user telemetry (with permission) on which widgets are used most to guide further development.
This structured action list provides a roadmap from initial setup through production readiness, breaking down tasks into concrete steps that AI agents (and human developers) can take to implement the vision of a Figma-quality, intent-driven, no-app-overhang canvas-based system.

High-Level Architecture for System Design
Thought for 2m 12s
Below is a refined and expanded action list that also includes a high-level architectural overview from the perspective of a senior architect. This should help guide AI agents and developers toward building a robust, scalable, and maintainable system.

High-Level Architecture Overview (Senior Architect’s Perspective)
Core Architectural Principles:

Event-Driven and Modular: The system should leverage an orchestrator that listens to user intents and triggers dynamic component loading. Communication is event-driven, ensuring loose coupling between the canvas, the orchestrator, and external services.
Micro-Frontends & Modular Tools: Each UI widget or tool is independently developed, tested, and deployed as a micro-frontend or a loadable WASM module. The main canvas app dynamically imports them as needed.
Backend as an API Gateway + Orchestrator: The backend acts as an orchestrator for intent resolution, connecting to AI APIs, databases, and external integrations. This separation of concerns ensures the frontend remains clean and focused on rendering and interaction.
Real-Time State Management: Use a combination of local state management (Zustand/Context) and real-time syncing (WebSockets or GraphQL subscriptions) for collaborative features.
Scalability and Performance: Preemptively design for scale. Use CDN for static assets, edge compute (like Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge Functions) for global low-latency response, and a caching layer for AI results and commonly used widget configurations.
